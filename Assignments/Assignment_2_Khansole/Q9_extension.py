A separate (optional) problem you could consider writing is based on a problem in Douglas Hofstadter’s Pulitzer-prize-winning book Gödel, Escher, Bach. That book contains many interesting mathematical puzzles, many of which can be expressed in the form of computer programs. In Chapter XII, Hofstadter mentions a wonderful problem that is well within the scope of what you know. The problem can be expressed as follows:

Pick some positive integer and call it n.
If n is even, divide it by two.
If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Continue this process until n is equal to one.
